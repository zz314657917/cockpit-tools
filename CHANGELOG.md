# Changelog

English · [简体中文](CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md)

All notable changes to Cockpit Tools will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---
## [0.9.15] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **Release publication now waits for full pipeline completion**: The release workflow now creates draft releases first and only marks them as `latest` after matrix builds, merged updater `latest.json`, checksum upload, and Homebrew cask update all succeed. This prevents in-app update prompts from appearing before release artifacts are fully ready.

---
## [0.9.14] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Floating sidebar quick-update action**: Added a compact action above the sidebar that follows updater lifecycle states (`Update` / `Downloading %` / `Restart`), so users can continue update flow without reopening settings pages.

### Changed
- **Updater retry and failure handling hardened**: Added retry-with-backoff plus retryable/non-retryable error classification for update check/download, with retry status feedback and sanitized error details in UI/logs.
- **Update check baseline interval changed to 1 hour**: Default update-check interval is now 1 hour, and legacy 6h/24h interval values are migrated to 1 hour automatically when settings are loaded.
- **macOS process probe path for desktop clients was switched to `ps`-first matching**: Antigravity/VS Code/Codex/Kiro/Windsurf process discovery now prioritizes command-line probing and keeps app-root path comparison, reducing protected-directory touches while improving process match stability for instance operations.
- **Antigravity macOS multi-instance startup behavior was tightened**: Non-default instances now launch via `open -n` without `--reuse-window`, and startup includes a short PID resolve polling window (up to 6s) for the target `user-data-dir`.
- **Codex quota refresh now synchronizes plan metadata back to account index**: `plan_type` is now synced from refreshed `id_token` and quota usage response into account summary index, so subscription badges can update without re-import.

### Fixed
- **Reopened update dialog now preserves prepared-update restart state**: If the same version is already downloaded, reopening the update dialog now stays in `Ready to restart` state instead of falling back to `Update now`.
- **Manual dialog restart now reuses unified apply-update pipeline**: `Restart now` in the update dialog now follows the same install/relaunch path as silent updates, preventing state divergence between update entry points.
- **GitHub Copilot instance injection no longer fails on macOS due to wrong Safe Storage key priority**: VS Code/Copilot injection now prefers Code-family Keychain entries before Antigravity entries, preventing `AES-CBC decryption failed: Unpad Error` when decrypting existing `github.auth`.

---
## [0.9.13] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Pending update notes local cache for post-restart changelog**: Added persisted `pending_update_notes.json` storage so downloaded update notes can be shown after restart without requiring online changelog fetch.

### Changed
- **Update check source is now fully unified to Tauri Updater metadata**: Removed backend GitHub Releases API polling for version detection; update availability now comes from updater endpoint metadata (`latest.json`) only.
- **Manual/silent update note rendering now reads updater release body**: Update dialog and silent-update pre-cache now parse bilingual sections directly from updater `notes`, while keeping browser-download fallback only for updater failures.

---
## [0.9.12] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Background auto update mode (zero-intervention)**: Added a `Settings > General > Background Auto Update` option. When enabled, the app checks updates normally, downloads new packages silently in the background, and prompts restart when the update is ready.
- **Post-update changelog popup on version jump**: Added startup version-jump detection based on locally recorded `last_run_version`. After an upgrade, the app now shows a “What’s New” dialog for the current version.
- **Silent update ready toast with restart action**: Added a bottom-right update toast after background download, with `Later` and `Restart` actions.

### Changed
- **Desktop updater pipeline migrated to Tauri Updater**: Integrated updater/process plugins and enabled updater artifacts + release endpoint config, so in-app update flow uses signed updater metadata.
- **Manual update dialog now supports in-app download/install progress**: The update modal now performs in-app update with progress/status/error display and falls back to opening the GitHub release page when updater flow fails.
- **Update settings persistence behavior was hardened**: Auto-update preference loading/saving now avoids first-render overwrite and only writes when user change or explicit state change is confirmed.
- **Update-related i18n coverage expanded across locale packs**: Added update toggle/progress/restart/version-jump translation keys in all supported locales.

---
## [0.9.11] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Fixed Windows switch/start crashes on non-ASCII install paths**: Windows extended-path normalization now uses Unicode-safe prefix handling, preventing `byte index is not a char boundary` panics on non-ASCII paths.

### Changed
- **Verification default model selection now prioritizes Flash**: In “Run check now”, the default model now selects the first option whose display name contains `flash` (case-insensitive), and falls back to the first available model when no match exists.

---
## [0.9.10] - 2026-03-02

### Changed
- **Official-aligned wakeup execution stability**: Extended official LS startup wait to 60s, aligned client-gateway trajectory polling window to 60s, and switched `app_data_dir` to an official-style IDE-level directory (`antigravity`, overridable by `AG_WAKEUP_OFFICIAL_LS_APP_DATA_DIR`).
- **Wakeup gateway error-handling flow now mirrors long-running cascade behavior**: When trajectory status remains `RUNNING`, intermediate `errorMessage` steps are treated as transient and polling continues before final fail/success decision.
- **Antigravity plan badge rendering unified across account surfaces**: Centralized tier badge mapping via `getAntigravityTierBadge` and reused it in Accounts and verification detail surfaces.
- **Instance account selector ordering now follows Accounts sorting across all platforms**: Account dropdown ordering in multi-instance views now reuses each platform’s Accounts sort logic (Antigravity / Codex / GitHub Copilot / Windsurf / Kiro), avoiding cross-page ordering drift.
- **Accounts sort preferences are now persisted for all platforms**: Sort field and sort direction in all account pages now persist to local storage and are restored after restart.
- **Instances list sort preferences are now persisted per platform**: Instance list sort field (`createdAt` / `lastLaunchedAt`) and direction now persist by app type, so restart no longer resets instance list sorting.

### Fixed
- **Temporary upstream failures now self-retry once in wakeup path**: `temporary`/HTTP 5xx style payloads from `AG_WAKEUP_ERROR_JSON` now trigger a delayed one-time retry before returning failure.
- **Wakeup verification detail now shows backend user-facing error message**: Detail list now renders `lastMessage` (with truncation), so messages like `Agent execution terminated due to error.` are visible.
- **Wakeup tasks now respect privacy masking for account emails**: Masking is now applied in task cards, test selectors, history rows, and copied debug text.

---
## [0.9.9] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Built-in User Manual page**: Added a new `manual` page with scenario-based sections (quick start, dashboard, provider accounts, multi-instance, fingerprints, wakeup/verification, settings, and import/export + troubleshooting), keyword search, and expand/collapse controls.
- **One-click manual entry points across key pages**: Added manual shortcuts to dashboard/header areas and account empty states (Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro) to reduce first-run friction.

### Changed
- **Manual page now supports direct action shortcuts**: Each section can jump directly to related pages (Dashboard, Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Multi-Instance, Fingerprints, Wakeup Tasks, Verification, Settings), and can open Platform Layout from the guide.
- **Manual localization coverage expanded across locale packs**: Added `manual.*` keys and `nav.manual` labels across all supported locale files to keep guide/navigation copy consistent in multi-language environments.

### Fixed
- **Fixed permission-prompt attribution to Cockpit when launching third-party apps on macOS**: When launching Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro from Cockpit, protected-directory permission prompts are now significantly less likely to be attributed to Cockpit.

---
## [0.9.8] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Refactored AccountsPages across 4 platforms (Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro)**: Introduced `useProviderAccountsPage` plus shared data extraction utilities to consolidate shared state/actions and reduce duplicated page logic.
- **Unified export UX across account pages**: Added `ExportJsonModal` + `useExportJsonModal`, aligned multi-account/single-account export flows, and added download-directory open capability permissions for the export modal flow.
- **Standardized OAuth copy and tab naming across locales**: Updated add-account OAuth labels/description copy to consistently use “OAuth Authorization”.
- **OAuth post-login now performs best-effort refresh**: Added post-login refresh passes for Antigravity quota and GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro token snapshots to reduce stale data right after authorization.
- **Path-missing guidance now carries retry context**: App-path guidance payload now supports `switchAccount` / `default` / `instance` retry intents so path save can continue the original user action.
- **Wakeup behavior switched to strict no-fallback mode**: Wakeup execution now requires explicit `project_id`; model fetch no longer falls back to hardcoded lists; scheduler no longer uses `fallback_times` outside the time window.
- **Instance window operation semantics tightened**: “Open instance window” now reports focus failures directly instead of auto-starting new processes.
- **Account identity matching is stricter**: Removed email-only merge fallback in Antigravity/Codex account matching paths; Codex-to-OpenCode auth payload now uses persisted `account_id` only.
- **Token parsing/refresh rules tightened for Windsurf/Kiro**: Windsurf token import accepts only API key or Firebase JWT formats; Kiro refresh now fails explicitly when refresh cannot be performed (no snapshot fallback).
- **Command trace pipeline added and made opt-in**: Added trace points for command EXEC/RESULT/SPAWN paths and kept it disabled by default unless `COCKPIT_COMMAND_TRACE=1`.
- **Quick settings quota-alert controls were componentized**: Extracted duplicated quota-alert UI logic into a shared rendering path in quick settings.

### Fixed
- **Launch-path validation now runs before switch/start execution**: When path is missing/invalid, backend returns `APP_PATH_NOT_FOUND:*` before stop/inject/restart actions.
- **Windows focus flow no longer hits `$PID` overwrite errors**: Focus scripts switched to a dedicated PID variable and retry loop for non-zero `MainWindowHandle` before calling focus APIs.
- **Windows executable-path matching reliability improved**: Added normalization for extended path prefixes (`\\?\`, `\\?\UNC\`), environment expansion, command-line exe extraction fallback, and sysinfo fallback diagnostics for path probe misses.
- **Path-missing guidance modal now matches settings visual style**: Reused quick-settings/settings shared styles for consistent title/path section/icon/typography/layout behavior.
- **Fixed Rust warnings in backend integration paths**: Cleaned warning points in token model and wakeup gateway reserved code paths so refactor branch warnings stay controlled.

---
## [0.9.7] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **macOS repeated privacy permission prompts suppressed**: Replaced broad `sysinfo` process refresh (which fetched `cwd`/`environ`/`root` for all processes) with targeted `ProcessRefreshKind` requests that only retrieve `exe` and `cmd`. This prevents sysinfo from touching protected directories on other processes and eliminates the repeated Music/Photos/Documents permission dialogs on macOS.

### Changed
- **Kiro/Windsurf quota cycle reset time now shows relative + absolute format**: `formatKiroResetTime` rewritten to output `Xd Xh (MM/DD HH:mm)` style, consistent with other platform reset time displays. Sub-day granularity now shows hours/minutes instead of rounding to days.
- **Kiro/Windsurf cycle remaining time shows hours when under 24 hours**: Quota cycle remaining text now switches to `Resets in Xh` when less than one day remains, instead of showing `0 days`.
- **Kiro dashboard card quota display simplified**: Removed redundant used/total and left lines from the Kiro mini-card in Dashboard; now shows `resetText` or `cycleText` directly, consistent with Windsurf card layout.

---
## [0.9.6] - 2026-02-28


### Changed
- **Unified account presentation pipeline across five platforms and multiple entry pages**: Added a shared presentation layer for display name, plan label (raw value), quota metrics, reset text, and usage summaries, and reused it in Dashboard, Accounts, and Instances pages (Antigravity / Codex / GitHub Copilot / Windsurf / Kiro) to avoid multi-place divergence.
- **Token import UX now provides concrete input examples**: Updated token/JSON placeholder copy across locales and added token-format helper styling to improve readability in add/import modals.

### Fixed
- **Antigravity tray quota lines now follow group settings**: Tray submenu now aggregates by configured display groups (including model alias compatibility), so tray output matches grouped quota cards instead of raw per-model lines.
- **Tray refresh now reacts immediately to group-setting updates**: Saving/changing/deleting/reordering groups triggers tray menu refresh without requiring restart/manual cache actions.
- **Re-added accounts can reuse previous fingerprint binding after deletion**: Added deleted-account fingerprint binding persistence and lookup, so delete/re-add flows preserve original fingerprint association when available.
- **Antigravity plan badge display is now unified to normalized tiers**: Instance/account surfaces now consistently show `PRO/ULTRA/FREE/UNKNOWN` instead of mixed raw subscription-tier strings.
- **Antigravity token example helper copy now fully uses i18n keys**: Removed hardcoded Chinese labels in the token example panel so locale switching stays consistent.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **Windows wakeup no longer pops black terminal windows**: Added hidden-process flags for official Language Server startup and Windows CLI probes (`netstat`, `where.exe`) used by wakeup-related flows.
- **Local wakeup gateway intermittent transport failures now self-recover once**: Added local health-check preflight, transport error classification, and one-time gateway cache rebuild retry for recoverable local connection/TLS/timeout failures.
- **Local gateway requests now bypass system proxy and use a canonical loopback address**: Gateway/official-LS local clients now enforce `no_proxy`, and loopback base URLs are normalized to `127.0.0.1` to reduce proxy/interception-related failures.

### Changed
- **Verification copy and action labels switched from “Verify” to “Detect” across all locales**: Added/used `wakeup.verification.actions.runCheckNow`, updated run-hint wording, and aligned the verification-page primary CTA/title.
- **GitHub Copilot instances quota row now includes Premium requests**: Instance account quota summary now shows Inline, Chat, and Premium usage percentages together.

---
## [0.9.4] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **Linux `.deb` blank/white window rendering on some environments**: Disabled transparent window by default (`transparent: false`) and added Linux WebKitGTK fallback (`WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` when unset) to improve render stability.
- **Windows account-switch flow could hang while probing Antigravity processes**: Added a 5-second timeout for PowerShell process probing and automatic fallback to `sysinfo` scanning to avoid blocking the switch path.
- **Switch-success but launch-failure now becomes user-visible**: If account data is switched but launching Antigravity fails, backend now returns an explicit error message so frontend can show a visible failure notice.
- **Official LS resolution now follows configured Antigravity app path on all desktop OSes**: Wakeup/verification now derive LS from `antigravity_app_path` on Windows/macOS/Linux (with platform-specific extension/bin path and filename priority), and return unified `APP_PATH_NOT_FOUND:antigravity` when missing so existing path-setup guidance is triggered before execution.

---
## [0.9.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **AppImage blank-page rendering on Linux (including Arch) caused by absolute asset paths**: Vite build output now uses relative asset paths (`base: "./"`), so packaged AppImage can resolve frontend JS/CSS correctly.

### Changed
- **Release-process documentation aligned to current completion rule**: Updated `docs/release-process.md` to treat `remote branch + remote tag` as release completion, while GitHub Actions/asset publishing remains a post-release async step.

---
## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- **Windows wakeup/verification now prechecks runtime readiness before execution**: Added a frontend + backend preflight gate so wakeup test and batch verification validate official LS readiness first, instead of failing after request dispatch.
- **Official LS path resolution now derives from configured Antigravity app path on Windows**: Runtime now resolves LS from the configured `antigravity_app_path` (`resources/app/extensions/antigravity/bin`), with deterministic filename priority and fallback matching in the same bin directory.

### Fixed
- **Path-missing guidance now triggers before wakeup starts**: When Antigravity app path or LS binary is unavailable on Windows, the existing `app-path-missing` flow is triggered immediately, preventing late 500 errors from gateway startup.

---
## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Announcement system (desktop)**: Added a full announcement pipeline with Tauri commands, frontend store/service/types, and announcement center UI (list/detail modal, unread badge, mark-read, refresh, popup, image preview, and action handling for tab/url/command).
- **Announcement source controls for dev testing**: Added local override support (`~/.antigravity_cockpit/announcements.local.json`) and debug workspace source (`announcements.json`) for `npm run tauri dev` testing, with persisted read-state/cache files.
- **Repository announcement seed file**: Added a repository-level `announcements.json` with a welcome announcement and feedback action for quick local debugging and remote source alignment.

### Changed
- **Remote-first announcement strategy for normal users**: Non-dev/runtime builds now skip local override files and use remote announcements (with cache/fallback) by default.
- **Dashboard header action area**: Replaced the dashboard date display with an inline `Announcement` action button; announcement entry is now shown in dashboard context instead of global full-page placement.
- **v0.9.0 announcement content is now fully localized**: Added/filled title, summary, body, and action copy for all 17 supported languages in `announcements.json`, so users see localized announcement content per language environment.
- **GitHub Copilot usage rendering alignment (dashboard + tray)**: Switched usage parsing to structured snapshot semantics (`completions` / `chat` / `premium_interactions`), added `Included` handling, and added a `Premium` metric line/dimension in both dashboard cards and tray summaries.
- **Locale and copy coverage for announcement/tray semantics**: Added `announcement.*` keys across all locale files and extended tray copy mapping with `Included` and GitHub Copilot metric labels (`Inline` / `Chat` / `Premium`).

---
## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Dedicated Antigravity account verification workspace**: added model-based batch account verification with live progress, persisted verification history, per-batch detail view, and status filters (`All` / `Success` / `Verification required` / `Failed`).
- **Official-aligned wakeup/verification transport**: added a `local gateway + official Language Server protocol` flow using `StartCascade` / `SendUserCascadeMessage` / `GetCascadeTrajectory` / `DeleteCascadeTrajectory` for wakeup conversations and account verification runs.
- **403 verification quick actions**: verification-required results now expose validation URL and actions (`Verify now`, copy validation URL, copy debug info) for self-service verification.

### Changed
- **Unified model-list rule across wakeup surfaces**: wakeup task model picker, verification picker, and quota-related model display now all derive from official `agentModelSorts[].groups[].modelIds`; when unavailable, fallback is limited to the fixed 6 recommended models.
- **Antigravity model grouping reduced to 3 groups**: default display groups are now `Claude / Gemini Pro / Gemini Flash`; `Gemini Image` group and legacy mapping are removed to avoid duplicate group rendering.
- **Verification-page UX and privacy alignment**: added batch selection/deletion flow, closable notices, and privacy-toggle-linked email masking consistent with the Accounts page.
- **GitHub Copilot (VS Code semantics) display alignment**: `individual` plans are now normalized to `PRO`; usage is derived from `quota_snapshots.completions/chat/premium_interactions`; cards and tables now include a `Premium requests` dimension with `Included` display support.
- **Wakeup custom-time interaction refinement**: custom time keeps a `time picker + quick input` interaction; empty state no longer shows a default time value; custom time input is now applied to next-run preview and task save even if `Add` is not clicked.

---
## [0.8.13] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Independent Dock icon visibility setting (macOS only)**: Added a `Hide Dock icon` option in Settings > General so Dock icon visibility can be controlled separately from close/minimize behavior.
- **Localization coverage for macOS window-behavior options**: Added translation keys for `minimizeBehavior` and `hideDockIcon` settings across supported locales.

### Changed
- **macOS window-behavior config model split**: Added persistent `minimize_behavior` and `hide_dock_icon` fields in local config and wired them through Tauri system commands and WebSocket config updates; startup now applies the Dock activation policy from saved config.
- **Tag edit modal visual polish (especially dark theme)**: Improved dark-theme background, borders, chip/remove-button styling, and input/placeholder/disabled states.
- **OAuth auth URL parameter cleanup**: Removed `include_granted_scopes=true` from generated OAuth authorization URLs.

### Fixed
- **macOS Dock visibility now updates immediately after saving settings**: Changing the Dock icon visibility option now reapplies the macOS activation policy without requiring an app restart.
- **Language-switch config saves preserve new macOS window fields**: WebSocket language updates now keep `minimize_behavior` and `hide_dock_icon` when writing config, avoiding accidental resets.

---
## [0.8.12] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **One-command GitHub Release + Homebrew Cask publisher**: Added `scripts/release/publish_github_release_and_cask.cjs` and `npm run release:github-and-cask` to build a `universal.dmg`, upload assets to GitHub Release, and update `Casks/cockpit-tools.rb` (with `--skip-build` / `--skip-gh` / `--skip-cask` / `--dry-run` support).

### Changed
- **Startup app-path detection strategy**: On startup, the app now loads local config first, probes only platforms without configured paths, and staggers detection calls with a small delay to reduce bursts of system path-detection commands.
- **Release-process docs expanded for Homebrew flow**: Updated `docs/release-process.md` with recommended `universal` build flow, checksum generation examples, GitHub CLI/Rust target prerequisites, and cask update ordering notes.
- **Release workflow restores automatic Homebrew Cask updates**: `release.yml` now restores the `update-homebrew-cask` job to compute `sha256` from the published `*_universal.dmg`, update `Casks/cockpit-tools.rb`, and open a cask PR after release assets are available.
- **Auto-merge is limited to generated cask PRs only**: The release workflow now enables auto-merge only for Homebrew cask PRs created on `automation/update-cask-v*` branches (squash + delete branch), without affecting normal PRs.

### Fixed
- **Windows black console flashes during startup**: Fixed unhidden `cmd /c reg query` calls in the VS Code registry fallback path detection flow. Background commands now run hidden, reducing startup black-window flashes for some Windows users.
- **Brand names and plan/tier labels incorrectly localized**: Restored original brand/product names and raw plan labels in non-English locales, including `Cockpit Tools`, `Antigravity`, `Codex`, `GitHub Copilot`, `Windsurf`, plus `accounts.tier.*`, `codex.plan.*`, and `kiro.plan.*`.
- **Locale-check false positives for brand names**: Added brand-name allowlist entries to the locale validation script so English brand strings are not flagged as missing localization.

---
## [0.8.11] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- **Antigravity quota backend fetch flow aligned with Antigravity.app**: Unified Cloud Code base URL selection for `loadCodeAssist` / `onboardUser` / `fetchAvailableModels` (Antigravity-style routing), passed `cloudaicompanionProject` through backend requests, and switched `onboardUser` to operation polling (`POST` + `GET`, 500ms poll interval). Local quota API cache is still retained, while the pre-cache backend flow is aligned.

---
## [0.8.10] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Windsurf email/password account import**: Added an `Email & Password` tab in Windsurf Add Account modal and wired Firebase sign-in flow to create local Windsurf accounts.

### Changed
- **Windsurf credits semantics aligned with monthly quota**: `availablePromptCredits` / `availableFlexCredits` are now treated as monthly total quota, and remaining credits are computed as `total - used`.
- **Password handling in sign-in flow**: Email is still normalized with trim, while password now keeps the original input (no trim) to avoid altering valid credentials.

### Fixed
- **Windsurf password-login i18n coverage**: Added missing `windsurf.addModal.password` and `windsurf.password.*` translation keys across locale files to prevent fallback language leakage.
- **Password-login log privacy**: Removed plain email output from Windsurf password-login logs to reduce PII exposure.

---
## [0.8.9] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Account card tags are now visible across all five platforms**: Account tags now render directly on grid cards in Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Kiro for faster visual identification.

### Changed
- **Card tag display is unified**: Tag chips now follow a consistent compact rule across platforms (show up to 2 tags with `+N` overflow).

### Fixed
- **Release checksum upload workflow no longer depends on local git checkout**: Added explicit `GH_REPO` context for `gh release` calls in the checksum upload job to avoid `fatal: not a git repository` failures.

---
## [0.8.8] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Codex quota windows now follow window presence**: Codex quota rendering is now driven by `primary_window` / `secondary_window` presence instead of always forcing two fixed lines.
- **Codex window labels now use Codex-style rules**: Window labels now use unified dynamic formatting (`5h`, `Weekly`, `Xd`, `Xh`, `Xm`) based on actual window minutes.
- **Multi-instance Codex account selector now shows plan badge**: Bound-account dropdown/list in Codex instances now shows subscription badges (`FREE/PLUS/PRO/TEAM/ENTERPRISE`) alongside account emails to reduce free-plan ambiguity.
- **Manual update check now always shows feedback**: Clicking `Check Updates` now shows loading state and explicit result feedback (`up to date` / `check failed`) instead of silent no-op when no new version is found.
- **Release workflow now auto-publishes checksums**: GitHub Release pipeline now automatically generates and uploads `SHA256SUMS.txt` from release assets, removing manual checksum upload.

### Refactored
- **Shared Codex quota-window helper introduced**: Codex account page, dashboard cards, and Codex instances now reuse the same window-label/window-visibility helper to keep display logic consistent.

---
## [0.8.7] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Unknown-tier rendering and filtering added**: Accounts with missing subscription tier now resolve to `UNKNOWN` (instead of falling back to `FREE`) in cards/tables, and the account filter dropdown now supports `UNKNOWN` as a dedicated option.
- **Unknown badge now uses warning styling**: `UNKNOWN` tier badges are highlighted in red to visually distinguish tier-identification anomalies from normal `FREE` accounts.
- **Quota modal badge consistency**: Quota details modal now always shows a tier badge, including `UNKNOWN` when subscription tier is unavailable.

### Fixed
- **No stale tier carry-over after refresh**: Removed backend behavior that preserved previous `subscription_tier` when the new quota payload had no tier, preventing old `PRO/ULTRA` labels from persisting incorrectly.
- **Tier-identification diagnostics improved**: Subscription identification logs now emit explicit `UNKNOWN` failure reasons (including status/body snippets and loadCodeAssist context) to distinguish API errors from successful responses without tier data.

---
## [0.8.6] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Model group auto-classification now ignores version suffixes**: Added prefix/pattern matching for model families so Claude and Gemini variants are grouped by family (Pro/Flash/Image) even when exact IDs are not pre-listed.
- **"Other Models" cleanup for Claude/Gemini variants**: Claude Sonnet/Opus variants and Gemini x Pro/Flash/Pro Image variants are now routed into their target default groups instead of falling into `Other Models`.
- **Default Gemini group labels renamed**: Group display names were updated from `G3-Pro`, `G3-Flash`, `G3-Image` to `Gemini Pro`, `Gemini Flash`, `Gemini Image` for version-agnostic naming.

### Fixed
- **Legacy group-name compatibility**: Existing saved group settings with legacy `G3-*` names are automatically migrated to the new Gemini labels on load.

---
## [0.8.5] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Kiro account ban detection**: Automatic detection of suspended/banned Kiro accounts. When the quota refresh API returns a ban signal (e.g. 403 FORBIDDEN), the account is automatically marked as `banned` with the reason stored.

### Changed
- **Banned account UI**: Account cards and table rows now show a 🔒 `forbidden` status badge and a greyed-out card style to visually distinguish banned accounts.
- **Banned account action restrictions**: The switch button is disabled for banned accounts; the dashboard recommendation algorithm and quota alert suggestions automatically exclude banned accounts.
- **Bulk refresh skips banned accounts**: Refresh-all now skips accounts already marked as banned, reducing unnecessary API calls, and logs the skipped count.
- **Quota alert excludes banned current account**: If the currently active account is banned, quota alert checks are skipped.

### Fixed
- **Error vs. ban state separation**: Refresh failures (`error`) and account bans (`banned`) are now recorded separately, preventing all refresh errors from being misclassified as generic errors.

---
## [0.8.4] - 2026-02-19

### Changed
- **Kiro JSON import now supports raw account snapshots**: The import pipeline now accepts Kiro-style raw JSON objects (and arrays) with fields like `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresAt`, `provider`, `profileArn`, and `usageData`, then maps them into normalized local accounts.
- **Kiro import parser is unified with OAuth snapshot mapping**: JSON import now reuses the same snapshot-to-payload extraction path as OAuth/local import, improving consistency of email/user/provider/plan/quota field parsing.

### Fixed
- **Slash datetime parsing for imported expiry**: Kiro token expiry values in `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss` format (e.g. `2026/02/19 02:01:47`) are now parsed correctly during import.
- **Bonus expiry fallback coverage**: `freeTrialExpiry` is now recognized as a fallback source when deriving Kiro add-on expiry days.

---
## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- **Tray platform matrix expanded with Kiro**: Added Kiro to tray platform ordering/display and account-count aggregation, and introduced Kiro account summary rendering in tray menus (plan + prompt/add-on remaining with reset time).
- **Legacy tray layout compatibility for Kiro rollout**: When loading old four-platform tray configs, Kiro is auto-appended only for legacy default layouts while preserving user-customized visibility/order.
- **Raw plan/tier labels enforced in account pages**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf account cards, tables, and filter options now show original plan/tier values directly (no localized remapping).

### Fixed
- **Auto-switch threshold boundary**: Account auto-switch trigger now fires when remaining percentage is less than or equal to threshold (`<=`) to avoid missing boundary cases at exact threshold.

---
## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- **OAuth callback server hardening**: Rewrote the local OAuth callback server to loop over incoming requests, silently ignoring non-callback requests (e.g. favicon), and only processing the actual `/oauth-callback` path. Added CORS preflight (OPTIONS) support and an explicit 404 response for unmatched routes.
- **OAuth CSRF protection**: OAuth authorization URL now includes a `state` parameter generated per flow; the callback server validates the returned state to prevent cross-site request forgery.
- **OAuth flow timeout & cleanup**: Added a configurable timeout for the OAuth callback wait; on timeout or failure the flow state is automatically cleaned up, and a user-facing retry message is returned.
- **OAuth redirect host normalization**: Changed OAuth redirect URI from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost` for broader browser/OS redirection compatibility.
- **Account identity matching overhaul**: Replaced the previous email-only account matching with a strict multi-factor identity matcher (`session_id` → `refresh_token` → `email + project_id`), plus a legacy single-email fallback for backward compatibility during upsert.

---
## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-17

### Changed
- **Plan/Tier labels now use raw values**: Account-card and table badges across Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro now display original backend/local plan values directly, while keeping existing style mapping.
- **Overview tabs use fixed default labels**: Platform overview tabs (`Account Overview` / `Multi-Instance`) now render default text directly to avoid cross-locale mismatch from platform-specific translation overrides.
- **Platform names are fixed to source labels**: Shared platform label rendering now always shows original platform names (`Antigravity`, `Codex`, `GitHub Copilot`, `Windsurf`, `Kiro`).
- **Codex switch behavior is configurable**: Added `codex_launch_on_switch` to backend/user config and wired it into Settings and Quick Settings so switching Codex can optionally skip auto launch/restart.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard privacy consistency**: Dashboard account emails are now masked by the same privacy toggle used in account/instance pages, with focus/visibility/storage sync to keep masking state consistent.
- **OpenCode switch-token sync reliability**: Fixed a regression where GPT account switching did not effectively replace OpenCode login credentials in runtime scenarios, causing the app session to stay on the previous account. (#51)
- **Dashboard card layout balance**: Fixed the Antigravity account card width behavior to avoid obvious right-side whitespace in dashboard layouts and improve visual balance. (#49)

---
## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Fifth platform is live**: Kiro officially joins the supported platform lineup with unified management alongside Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf.
- **Core Kiro flows are now available**: OAuth/Token/JSON/local import, account switching, quota refresh, multi-instance lifecycle, and app path configuration are all included.
- **Platform-layer refactor**: Instance services, account stores, and overview tabs were unified into reusable platform abstractions to reduce future integration cost.
- **Key fixes in this release**: Hardened Kiro import ID validation against path traversal and filled missing locale keys to reduce mixed-language fallback in non-default locales.

---
## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Tray platform layout persistence**: Added backend tray layout config storage (`tray_layout.json`) and command `save_tray_platform_layout` to save tray visibility, order, and sort mode.
- **Tray visibility control in layout modal**: Added `Show in tray` toggle in platform layout management and synchronized the related locale key across supported languages.
- **Expanded tray platform coverage**: Added GitHub Copilot and Windsurf tray submenus with account/quota summary and direct navigation targets.

### Changed
- **Tray menu architecture**: Refactored tray menu generation to dynamic multi-platform rendering, supporting auto/manual ordering and overflow grouping (`More platforms`).
- **Tray refresh trigger points**: GitHub Copilot/Windsurf refresh, OAuth completion, token import, and account switch flows now refresh tray content immediately; language changes also trigger tray rebuild.
- **Frontend tray event handling**: `tray:refresh_quota` now refreshes Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf in one flow; tray navigation now recognizes `github-copilot` and `windsurf`.
- **Platform layout sync strategy**: Added debounced frontend-to-backend tray layout sync on reorder/visibility changes and on initial app load.

### Fixed
- **Tray visibility filtering correctness**: Fixed tray platform filtering so disabled platforms remain hidden and the empty-state item appears when no tray platform is selected.
- **Log privacy hardening**: Logger now masks email addresses in log messages to reduce exposure of sensitive identifiers.

---
## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Group management "Other Models" bucket**: Added an auto-collected `Other Models` group that lists non-default models discovered from account quotas.
- **Auth-mode model blacklist filtering**: Added blacklist filtering by model ID/display name in group management to exclude blocked Gemini 2.5/chat variants.
- **Claude Opus 4.6 mapping coverage**: Added `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` and `MODEL_PLACEHOLDER_M26` to default/recommended model mappings and wakeup recommendations.

### Changed
- **Group settings migration behavior**: Loading group settings now incrementally backfills missing default mappings/names/order while preserving user custom configuration.
- **Group modal data source**: Accounts page now passes live model IDs/display names into group management, improving model label display and "other model" classification accuracy.
- **Model display order alignment**: Account quota display order was aligned to include Claude Opus 4.6 under the Claude group.

### Fixed
- **Locale completeness for group settings**: Synchronized `group_settings.other_group` across all supported locales to avoid missing-key fallbacks.

---
## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Cross-platform quota alert workflow**: Added quota alert calculations and event dispatch for Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf, with per-platform model/credit metric detection.
- **Quota alert settings surface**: Added quota alert enable/threshold controls in both Settings and Quick Settings, with synchronized i18n keys.
- **Global modal infrastructure**: Added reusable global modal store/hook/component (`useGlobalModal` + Zustand + `GlobalModal`) for cross-module prompts and alert actions.
- **Notification capability integration**: Integrated Tauri notification capability in app runtime/capabilities with macOS click-to-focus handling.

### Changed
- **Quota refresh behavior**: Refresh-all and refresh-current flows for Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf now trigger quota-alert checks after successful quota/token refresh.
- **Alert payload model**: `quota:alert` payload now carries `platform`, and the frontend modal quick-switch action now routes to the correct platform switch flow/page.
- **Settings input interaction**: Refresh interval and threshold controls now use preset + inline numeric input mode with Enter/blur apply behavior.
- **Config model propagation**: `quota_alert_enabled` and `quota_alert_threshold` are now persisted through command save/get and websocket language-save paths.
- **Log retention policy**: Logger initialization now cleans up expired `app.log*` files older than 3 days.

### Fixed
- **Quota alert listener lifecycle**: Prevented duplicate `quota:alert` subscriptions caused by async unlisten timing in React effect cleanup.
- **Threshold consistency at 0%**: Runtime threshold normalization now honors `0%`, matching frontend options and user expectations.

- **Quota refresh fallback behavior**: Failed refresh now preserves the last valid quota snapshot to avoid clearing displayed quota to zeros.
- **Switch/injection robustness**: Improved handling and diagnostics around account binding and startup path mismatch cases.

---
## [0.6.10] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **macOS distribution postflight hook**: Added Cask postflight logic to auto-remove quarantine attributes.
- **Release process templates/scripts**: Added release checklist/docs and helper scripts for preflight validation and checksum generation.

### Changed
- **Unified switch flow (overview -> default instance)**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot overview switching now follows default-instance startup logic (PID-targeted close -> inject -> start).
- **GitHub Copilot flow alignment**: Overview switching and multi-instance startup now share the same injection/start semantics.
- **Instance lifecycle alignment**: Unified start/stop/close behavior across Antigravity/Codex/VS Code with managed-directory matching and PID tracking.
- **Windows VS Code launch strategy**: Switched to `cmd /C code` for `.cmd` wrapper compatibility.
- **PID resolution semantics alignment**: VS Code PID resolving/focus now uses `Option<&str>` semantics (`None` => default instance), matching Antigravity behavior and reducing default-instance mismatch edge cases.
- **Docs and settings guidance**: Updated README/security/settings guidance for new switching and path behaviors.
- **Localization synchronization**: Updated locale keys across all supported languages for Copilot switching, open-window action, privacy mode, and related error messages.

### Fixed

---
## [0.5.4] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Codex OAuth login session API**: Added command set `codex_oauth_login_start` / `codex_oauth_login_completed` / `codex_oauth_login_cancel` with `loginId + authUrl` response model.
- **OAuth timeout event contract**: Added backend timeout event payload (`loginId`, `callbackUrl`, `timeoutSeconds`) for frontend-driven retry UX.

### Changed
- **Codex OAuth flow alignment**: Switched from code-push completion to login-session completion (backend stores callback code by session, frontend completes by `loginId`).
- **UI authorization flow**: OAuth link is prepared and shown in modal first; browser open remains explicit user action.
- **Timeout retry UX**: On timeout, the main OAuth CTA switches to `Refresh authorization link`; after refresh succeeds, it switches back to `Open in Browser`.
- **Timeout behavior**: Timeout no longer triggers automatic authorization re-creation loops; retry is user-triggered.
- **OAuth observability**: Refined OAuth logs to concise operational checkpoints (session creation/start/timeout/cancel/complete), removing verbose full-payload noise.

### Removed
- **Legacy Codex OAuth commands**: Removed `prepare_codex_oauth_url`, `complete_codex_oauth`, `cancel_codex_oauth` and related frontend/service fallback paths.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate callback completion risk**: Hardened frontend callback handling with session and in-flight guards to reduce duplicate-complete races.
- **OAuth timeout UI duplication**: Resolved repeated timeout error presentation in modal by consolidating timeout-state rendering.

---
## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Blank instance initialization mode**: Added a new initialization option when creating instances (`Copy source instance` / `Blank instance`) so users can create an empty directory without copying profile data.
- **Uninitialized-instance guide modal**: Clicking account binding on an uninitialized blank instance now opens a guide modal with a **Start now** action.
- **Instance sorting controls**: Added sort field selection (`Creation time` / `Launch time`) and ascending/descending toggle in the multi-instance toolbar.
- **In-app delete confirmation modal**: Instance deletion now uses an internal modal (with top-right close action) instead of relying on the system dialog.

### Changed
- **Instance status model**: Added `initialized` to Antigravity/Codex instance view payloads and wired it through frontend state.
- **Binding safety checks**: Binding is now blocked for uninitialized instances (disabled UI + backend validation with explicit error).
- **Instance list layout**: Status is shown in a dedicated column next to instance name; actions column is now sticky/opaque so it stays visible on narrow windows without content bleed-through.
- **Dropdown rendering split**: Inline list account dropdown renders via portal (outside container), while modal dropdown keeps in-container rendering to avoid clipping and style conflicts.
- **PID visibility rule**: PID is hidden when an instance is not running.
- **Post-start delayed refresh**: Added delayed refresh (~2s) after start to reduce stale `pending initialization` state after first boot.
- **i18n alignment**: Added and synchronized new instance-flow keys across all 17 locale files.

### Fixed

### Changed
- **Wakeup history storage**: Moved history persistence to backend storage with higher retention (up to 100 items).
- **macOS launch strategy**: Prefer direct executable launch (PID available), fallback to `open -a` for `.app` paths.
- **App path reset**: Reset now auto-detects and fills the path instead of clearing it.
- **Account switching**: Update default instance PID after launch; emit app-path-missing events when needed.
- **Documentation**: Added multi-instance sections and image placeholders for Antigravity/Codex.
- **i18n**: Added new app-path related keys and ensured locale consistency.
